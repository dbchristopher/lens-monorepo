### Default Link

The `<Link />` component renders an `<a>` tag that accepts and `href` property. You can also supply an optional `id` property if you want to give your anchor an id.

<Playground>
  <Link href="https://looker.com">👋 I am a link!</Link>
  <Link href="https://looker.com" id="thumbs-up">
    👍 I am a link with an id
  </Link>
</Playground>
