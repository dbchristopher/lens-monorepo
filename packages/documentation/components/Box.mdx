### About Box

`<Box />` is a low level component whose primary purpose is to provide a utility for easily controlling the spacing around elements in a consistent way using the [Lens spacing values](/#!/Spacing).

##### Borders

Boxes can have borders.

<Playground>

    width="50px"
    height="50px"
    bg="palette.purple200"
    border="1px solid black"
    borderRadius="4px"
  >
